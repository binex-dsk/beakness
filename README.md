TODO:::::::::

- [x] work
- [x] support FoC
- [x] create motor control requests
- [ ] motor config requests/classes
    - [ ] ClosedLoop: wrap
    - [ ] Current Limits
    - [ ] Fused CANCoder of some sort
    - [ ] Limit switch configs
        - [ ] Support external (DIO) pins
    - [ ] Motion Magic
    - [ ] Duty Cycle: deadband, peak forward/reverse, open/closed loop ramps
    - [ ] Same for voltage and torque
    - [ ] add continuous wrap
    - [ ] add continuous wrap

- [x] swerve control requests
    - [ ] Facing Angle
    - [ ] X-Drive
    - [ ] Robot Centric
    - [ ] SysId control of some sort
- [ ] look forward to prevent slips and such
- [ ] Collision detection; ignore odometry
- [ ] Slip detection
- [ ] Real feedforward
- [ ] Standardized Simulation
- [ ] Differential drivetrain requests
- [ ] TorqueCurrent output
- [ ] More clean API for duty vs voltage vs torque
- [ ] General cleanup of old stuff
- [ ] Figure out status signals
    - [ ] Clean up DataSignal in general
    - [ ] Getter/setter stuff, more clean API overall
- [ ] 250Hz odometry
    - depends on status signals
- [ ] PWM controller w/ DIO encoder?
- [ ] Fused CANCoder
